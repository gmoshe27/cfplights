Crossfit Primeval Power lifting Judging Lights

Crossfit Primeval in South Brunswick, NJ hosted a power lifting competition on September 5, 2015. I built a light box 
to make it easy for the judges to enter a judgement without the need for a lot of wires. Each judge uses a Playstation 3 
controller to enter a good or bad judgement and the light box will display white or red accordingly. A final judgement 
is displayed only when all three judges enter their judgement, as not to sway or influence another judge.

The main judge's controller can control the light box to start a new judgement request, or enter into demo mode, which is 
what the lights are doing at the [beginning of this clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUDHNlBz-2I)

The system is built using a Raspberry Pi, and all of the software was written in C.
